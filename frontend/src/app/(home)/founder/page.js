                              <p className='text-xs text-gray-600 my-4'>Dear, All</p>
                              <p className='text-xs text-gray-600 my-7'>Welcome to Umeed Global School, a place where hope takes flight and dreams find their wings. As I look back on the journey that led to the creation of UGS, I am filled with a profound sense of purpose. For years, I have witnessed the immense potential within underprivileged children-a potential often stifled by a lack of access to quality education. This realization became the driving force behind Umeed-a heartfelt commitment to bridge that gap and empower these young minds to rise with dignity, guided by faith, and equipped to serve humanity.</p>
                              <p className='text-xs text-gray-600 my-7'>Umeed, meaning “hope,” is not merely a name; it is the very essence of our mission. It is almost beyond belief that just seven years ago, our journey began with only three orphaned children at a modest 1200 sq. ft. rented apartment. Little did I know then that UGS would blossom into one of the most renowned schools in the country. Reflecting on this incredible journey, I see several key elements that have been vital to our success:</p>
                              <p className='text-xs text-gray-600 my-7'>Pure Intentions: My aim has always been to earn the pleasure of Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala through sincere service to mankind, especially to the underprivileged and most vulnerable among us. Every decision, every initiative at UGS has been guided by the intention to uplift those often left behind, and to create a space where their potential is nurtured with care and compassion.</p>
                              
                              <div className='max-w-125 rounded-lg overflow-hidden'>
                                  <Image src='/assets/gallery1.jpg' alt='Gallery image 1' width={600} height={400} className='w-full h-90 object-cover md:ml-20 rounded-lg' />
                              </div>
                              
                              <p className='text-xs text-gray-600 my-7'>Extreme Hard Work: Building a school from the ground up-especially when starting with so little-demanded tireless, relentless effort. I often wish I could adequately express the hard work and dedication that have defined these past seven years. Such an endeavor, I have come to realize, is only made possible through the tawfeeq (divine enablement) granted by Allah to His servants when they strive sincerely in His path.</p>
                              <p className='text-xs text-gray-600 my-7'>Immense Sacrifice: This journey has required significant personal sacrifices-of time, resources, and emotions. It is true that no great achievement is reached without giving up what one treasures the most. In my case, I humbly acknowledge that I have sacrificed my youth for this noble cause.</p>
                              <p className='text-xs text-gray-600 my-7'>Indeed, as I have mentioned before, I have always tried to keep my intentions focused, hopefully pure. By the will of Allah, I could labor with extreme hard work and immense sacrifices. Yet, even with all these efforts, the reality remains that my work alone could never have achieved such results. This is not merely the outcome of my endeavors-it is solely the will of Allah. I understand that even with all my intentions, efforts, and sacrifices, it would have fallen short without His guidance. Allah has enabled me to maintain my purity of intent, granted me the strength to work diligently, and provided the opportunity to sacrifice. All I can do is remain in a state of constant shukr, for that is the least I owe in return.</p>
                              <p className='text-xs text-gray-600 my-7'>All of these efforts stand firmly upon one unshakeable foundation-yaqeen (trust) in Allah. Every great achievement, every soaring height, can only be reached through that trust, when one raises his hands in du’a with the firm conviction that Allah will fulfill every sincere plea. With that yaqeen, I have labored from day one, and I pray to continue doing so, leaving all my affairs in His hands.</p>
                              <p className='text-xs text-gray-600 my-7'>It is essential that every stakeholder of our school is aligned with this vision. Every brick of UGS should resonate with the purpose we serve, and every member-be they students, parents, or staff-must live each moment in pursuit of this vision. Only when we are united in this purpose can we truly achieve the great heights that our vision demands.</p>
                              <p className='text-xs text-gray-600 my-7'>I firmly believe that this success is a blessing from Allah and can only be truly attributed to Him. I am merely an agent through which His will is manifested, and all praise and gratitude belong to Him alone. I am eternally grateful (shukr) to Allah for His guidance and blessings, and I extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who has been a part of this journey-the staff, the parents, the community, and most importantly, the students.</p>
                              <p className='text-xs text-gray-600 my-7'>Umeed is not just a name; it is a testament to the power of hope, hard work, and unwavering faith. Our mission here at Umeed Global School is to cultivate not merely successful individuals, but true leaders for our community and nation-leaders guided by humane principles and imbued with the highest moral and ethical standards. Our vision transcends academic excellence; we are deeply committed to instill our students with the values of compassion, empathy, and social responsibility. We strive to impart knowledge that empowers them in this world while also helping them to better believe in Allah SWT and deepen their love for Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).</p>
                              <p className='text-xs text-gray-600 my-7'>We believe that education is not simply the acquisition of knowledge, but a transformative process that ignites curiosity, fosters critical thinking, and cultivates a lifelong love for learning. At Umeed, we strive to create an environment where every child feels seen, heard, and valued. We nurture their unique talents, encourage them to explore their passions, and empower them to become agents of positive change within communities.</p>
                              <p className='text-xs text-gray-600 my-7'>Crucially, we are devoted to train and nurture our students to become future leaders in the field of innovation. We aim to equip them with the skills and mindset necessary to think creatively, solve problems effectively, and drive positive change through innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>
                              <p className='text-xs text-gray-600 my-7'>Umeed Global School is more than just an institution-it is a family. We believe in fostering a strong partnership among all stakeholders. The foundation of this ecosystem rests on three crucial pillars: the students, the parents, and the staff. It is vital that these pillars support and strengthen each other, as they form the very bedrock of Umeed Global School. Our dedicated teachers are the heart of UGS, tirelessly nurturing young minds and inspiring a love for learning. Their passion, commitment, and unwavering belief in each student’s potential are invaluable. I am also deeply grateful for the generous contributions of our donors, friends, and extended family. Their support-both financial and otherwise-has been instrumental in our growth, providing our students with the resources they need to thrive. Their steadfast belief in our vision and mission has fueled our progress and transformed this dream into a reality.</p>
                              <p className='text-xs text-gray-600 my-7'>I firmly believe that every child deserves the opportunity to reach their full potential, and we remain committed to providing them with the tools and resources they need to thrive.</p>
                              <p className='text-xs text-gray-600 my-7'>May Allah continue to guide us as we move forward, and may our collective efforts continue to reflect the power of hope, hard work, and faith. All praise and gratitude belong to Allah alone, the source of all strength and success.</p>
